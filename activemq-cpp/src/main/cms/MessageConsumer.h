     * A client uses a <code>MessageConsumer</code> to received messages
     * from a destination.
     *
     * A client may either synchronously receive a message consumer's messages
     * or have the consumer asynchronously deliver them as they arrive.
     *
     * For synchronous receipt, a client can request the next message from a
     * message consumer using one of its <code>receive</code> methods. There are
     * several variations of <code>receive</code> that allow a client to poll or
     * wait for the next message.
     *
     * For asynchronous delivery, a client can register a
     * <code>MessageListener</code> object with a message consumer. As messages
     * arrive at the message consumer, it delivers them by calling the
     * <code>MessageListener</code>'s <code>onMessage</code> method.
     *
     * When the MessageConsumer's close method is called the method can block while
     * an asynchronous message delivery is in progress or until a <code>receive</code>
     * operation completes.  A blocked consumer in a <code>receive</code> call will
     * return a Null when the close method is called.
     *
     * While the MessageConsumer implements the Startable and Stoppable interfaces it is
     * not required to implement these methods and can throw an UnsupportedOperation
     * exception if they are not available for the given CMS provider.
     *
