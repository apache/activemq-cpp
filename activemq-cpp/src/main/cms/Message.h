    /**
     * Root of all messages.  As in JMS, a message is comprised of 3 parts:
     * CMS-specific headers, user-defined properties, and the body.
     *
     * <B>Message Bodies</B>
     *
     * The CMS API defines four types of message bodies, each type is contained within its
     * own Message Interface definition.
     *
     *   - Stream - A StreamMessage object's message body contains a stream of primitive values
     *              in the C++ language. It is filled and read sequentially.  Unlike the
     *              BytesMessage type the values written to a StreamMessage retain information
     *              on their type and rules for type conversion are enforced when reading back
     *              the values from the Message Body.
     *   - Map - A MapMessage object's message body contains a set of name-value pairs, where
     *           names are std::string objects, and values are C++ primitives. The entries can
     *           be accessed sequentially or randomly by name.  The MapMessage makes no garuntee
     *           on the order of the elements within the Message body.
     *   - Text - A TextMessage object's message body contains a std::string object. This message
     *            type can be used to transport plain-text messages, and XML messages.
     *   - Bytes - A BytesMessage object's message body contains a stream of uninterpreted bytes.
     *             This message type is for literally encoding a body to match an existing message
     *             format. In many cases, it is possible to use one of the other body types,
     *             which are easier to use.
     *
     * <B>Message Properties</B>
     *
     * Message properties support the following conversion table. The marked cases
     * must be supported. The unmarked cases must throw a CMSException. The
     * String-to-primitive conversions may throw a runtime exception if the primitive's
     * valueOf method does not accept the String as a valid representation of the
     * primitive.
     *
     * A value written as the row type can be read as the column type.
     *
